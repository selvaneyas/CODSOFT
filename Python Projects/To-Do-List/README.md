- Task Update: Mark tasks as completed or update task details with ease.
- Task Deletion: Remove tasks from your to-do list when they're no longer needed.
- List Display: View your entire to-do list at a glance.

## Setting up the Development Environment
When starting the TO-DO List project with Python, the first important step is to set up the development environment. This involves:

- Installing Python
- Configuring environment variables
- Integrating the essential tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the `To_Do_List.py` file.
2. Make sure `Python 3` is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing 'To_Do_List.py'.
4. Run the application with the command:  ```python To_Do_List.py ``` 


5. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install tkinter pillow
    ```
    
## File Structure

- `To_Do_List_basic.py`: CLI version source code.
- `To_Do_List_basic1.py`: GUI version source code.
- `to_do_list.json`: JSON file to store tasks.
- `images/`: Directory containing images for the GUI version.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with it using the menu options:
1. **Add Task**: Add a new task by entering its description.
2. **List Tasks**: Display all tasks with their current status.
3. **Update Task**: Update the description of an existing task.
4. **Mark Task as Done**: Mark a specific task as completed.
5. **Delete Task**: Remove a task from your list.
